# Group chat

this is a group chat based on Nodejs and socket io for which I wrote an old article [here](https://opensourceforu.com/2017/01/develop-real-time-applications-websockets-socket-io-using-node-js/)

This is a repo is an update to that with socket io 2.0, while implementing almost a the same functionalities mentioned in the artical.

This is not yet complete, and I am working on it.

Libraries used:
* nodejs and [socket.io](https://socket.io)
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io) for CSS and UI
* [Jquery](https://jquery.com)

### Go on, play around with it!
